## Description

Week One Challenge Thomas' First Ever Module. ðŸ˜Ž

The current repository contains a refactored codebase for the Horiseon Marketing Agency's Website, a solution to the UofT Fullstack Developer Bootcamp(2023) Module(01) Challenge. The focus is on web accessibility standards and search engine optimization, the purpose of the Frontend Mentor challenge was to improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. The project showcases semantic HTML5 elements, logical HTML structure, accessible image attributes, and best practices for organizing CSS. The README file provides an overview of the project, the challenges faced, what was learned during the process, and plans for continued development in the field of web development.

# Overview

## The Challenge:
1. View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size.
2. See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action.
3. Improve website responsiveness to cater to various screen sizes and devices.
4. Implement smooth navigation with scroll and transitions
5. Add interactive elements to engage users.
6. Optimize website performance by leveraging modern web development tools.

## The Process:
I initialized and configured a GitHub repository to maintain version control for this project. The project utilizes GitHub pages to easily publish this project for other to view. I initially created the HTML backbone then styles the borders and flex boxes to get an idea of how to make the divs flow into place. Once done, I added all the CSS classes and queries to make the style have a easy flow.

## Assigned User Story:
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria:
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Usage Instructions: 
1. Browse the deployed application, navigate through the website, interact with its elements, and check its responsiveness on different screen sizes.
2. Modify the code (optional): To make changes to the website or study the code, open the project folder in your preferred code editor. Examine the index.html file for the website structure and content, and the assets/css/style.css file for the styling.
3. Preview changes (optional): Made modifications to the code? Save changes and refresh the index.html file in your web browser to see the updates... enjoy!

## What I Learned:

I learned about mobile-first web development, CSS styling, flex boxes, and HTML. This allowed me to make the pricing card eye-catching and reactive for desktop and mobile application

This helped cement the many CSS properties and how they affect HTML tags. On hover tags are helpful for users to see interactivity.

Learning more about flex boxes has also greatly improved my front-end workflow.

- The importance of web accessibility
- Implementing semantic HTML elements
- Ensuring logical structure in HTML
- Adding alt attributes to image elements
- Ensuring heading attributes fall in sequential order
- Writing concise and descriptive titles

## Continued Development.

Throughout my journey, I want to continue to improve my over all foundation and comprehension through the following:

1. Enhance understanding of accessibility best practices.
2. Learn responsive design techniques for optimal viewing on various devices.
3. Explore modern CSS frameworks and tools for efficient styling
4. Develop proficiency in JavaScript for added interactivity
5. Gain experience with version control systems, such as Git, for efficient collaboration.
6. Familiarize with popular web development tools and libraries to improve development workflow.
