## My process

I initialized and configured a GitHub repository to maintain version control for this project. The project utilizes GitHub pages to easily publish this project for other to view. I initially created the HTML backbone then styles the borders and flex boxes to get an idea of how to make the divs flow into place. Once done, I added all the CSS classes and queries to make the style have a easy flow.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Styled Components - For styles 
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned about mobile-first web development, CSS styling, flex boxes, and HTML. This allowed me to make the pricing card eye-catching and reactive for desktop and mobile application

This helped cement the many CSS properties and how they affect HTML tags. On hover tags are helpful for users to see interactivity.

Learning more about flex boxes has also greatly improved my front-end workflow.

### Continued development

Throughout my journey, I want to continue to improve my over all foundation and comprehension.
